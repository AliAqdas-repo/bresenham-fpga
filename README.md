# Bresenham Circle Drawing Algorithm in FPGA
Bresenham Circle Drawing algorithm is a lightweight algorithm to draw circles on computer that only computes points for an octant of circle, and uses eight way symmetry to draw a full circle.
## Implementation Details
1. Implemented Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm in Verilog to draw variable sized and colored circles.
2. Utilized University of Toronto's VGA Adapter to display the output on LCD using DE1-SoC.
